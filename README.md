This web application generates a random password by taking the data from user input selctions.  The user must select a password lenght between 8 and 128 characters and if they click no on all password options, it will alert them to try again.  I decided to build all arrays separately and then combine a final array based on what password options the user wants.  The random number generator picks a random value based on the final lenght of my final array.  The password array then builds on itself as the loop continues until the password character number is reached.
